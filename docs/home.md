> Evolution: Extensible CRUD component for VueJS --> ExpressJS full-stack app development cookbook and recipes --> common components for multiple apps --> automated QA, test, CI/CD with Cloud container deployment

## Design Considerations

- keep technical debt in view - Rule #1 - Do Not Let Technical Debt Build Up
- keep in mind https://12factor.net/
  - Logging (Use APM instead?) - use console.log & morgan
- scalable in terms of application use cases & traffic load
- aim For simplicity, maintainability, testability, take note of size & speed
- avoid / move away from using bundlers such as Webpack, keep tooling minimal
- automated ci/cd, testing, software quality gate, devopsec, cloud, container orchestration
- modularity - reduce exposure to rewrite due to code obsolecense
- code reuse - reduce writing same code for each new application, keep code & dependencies updated
- balance dependencies use and native code
  - vee-validate from version 2 to 3 broke many things, might as well stick with HTML5 validation
  - momentjs is too big, date-fns from version 1 to 2 broke things, use native JS Date Object, Intl.DateTimeFormat, etc. instead
  - nuxt-auth could not handle 2FA or refresh token so cannot be used
- limit number of languages (e.g. use JS for everything)

## JS Native Libraries
- Intl
- Fetch
- Date
- Canvas
- WebGL
