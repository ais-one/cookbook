Great question! Here's a complete, working setup. The key insight is that with OIDC you **don't** store any AWS credentials in your CI/CD — the pipeline authenticates via a JWT token and assumes an IAM role that has access to your S3 state bucket.

There are two parts: the AWS infrastructure (IAM role + S3 bucket) and the CI/CD pipeline config.Here's how the three pieces fit together:

**Step 1 — Bootstrap the AWS infrastructure** (first artifact). Run this once manually (or via a separate bootstrap pipeline) to create the OIDC provider, IAM role, S3 bucket, and DynamoDB lock table. Note that this bootstrap itself needs AWS credentials — you can run it locally with your personal AWS CLI credentials just this once.

**Step 2 — Configure your Terraform project** (second artifact). The `backend.tf` points at your S3 bucket and DynamoDB table. Crucially, there are no credentials hardcoded — the provider picks them up from the IAM role assumed by the pipeline.

**Step 3 — Set up the GitHub Actions workflow** (third artifact). The key is the `permissions` block at the top — `id-token: write` is what enables OIDC. The `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action handles the JWT exchange automatically and injects `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` as temporary env vars for the rest of the job.

**A few things to customize:**

- Replace `my-org/my-repo` in the trust policy condition with your actual GitHub org and repo name.
- Replace `123456789012` with your AWS account ID.
- The `key` in `backend.tf` is the path within the S3 bucket — use a pattern like `envs/prod/terraform.tfstate` so multiple environments can share the same bucket.
- Add your actual Terraform resource permissions to the IAM policy (EC2, RDS, etc.) — start with only what you need.

Want me to adapt this for GitLab CI, or show the equivalent setup for AliCloud?

That's a full production-grade dual-cloud infrastructure. Let me build the complete AWS equivalent of everything we've set up for AliCloud.Here's the full AWS equivalent laid out side-by-side with AliCloud.

**AWS file structure**
```
aws/

```

**AliCloud → AWS service mapping**

| AliCloud | AWS | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| OSS | S3 | OAC replaces public bucket ACL for static sites |
| ACR Enterprise | ECR | ECR has image scanning built-in, IMMUTABLE tags |
| RDS PostgreSQL | RDS PostgreSQL | Multi-AZ is a flag; AliCloud needs secondary_zone_id |
| ApsaraDB Redis | ElastiCache Redis | AWS uses auth_token; AliCloud uses password |
| Function Compute (FC3) | Lambda | Both run containers; Lambda integrates with ALB natively |
| SAE | ECS Fargate | ECS uses task definitions + service rolling deploys |
| ALB | ALB | Near-identical; AWS ALB routes Lambda and ECS on same listener |
| WAF v3 | WAFv2 | AWS has richer managed rule groups; CloudFront WAF must be in us-east-1 |
| DCDN | CloudFront | CloudFront adds security headers policy + SPA 403/404 fallback |
| NAT Gateway + EIP | NAT Gateway + EIP | Identical concept; AWS requires IGW for public subnets |
| RAM OIDC | IAM OIDC | `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` handles the JWT exchange automatically |

**One important AWS-specific nuance**

The CloudFront WAF (`waf.tf`) must be created in `us-east-1` regardless of your stack's region — this is an AWS hard requirement. The `provider "aws" { alias = "us_east_1" }` block handles this. Your ACM certificate for CloudFront also needs to exist in `us-east-1`, which is why `terraform.tfvars.example` calls this out explicitly. You'll need two ACM certs if your stack is not already in `us-east-1`.
