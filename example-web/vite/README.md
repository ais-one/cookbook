# Example Use of vite / vitepress

**IMPORTANT - Moving this over to repository [https://github.com/ais-one/vue-crud-x](https://github.com/ais-one/vue-crud-x)

Let's see if we can use vite for a more-or-less real-life application

And let's try out vitepress

And also try out Vue 3 composition API

Use ESM libraries... this means no axios for now unless they have an esm build or use snowpack

## Vite

We should have the following
- Vuex
- VueRouter
