# Read Me First

## Resuable JS frameworks how to...

for template (framework) repo
1. exclude configurable files from repo (e.g. .env), but include sample config files (e.g. .env.sample)
2. create an folder where all custom code is placed, framework must not touch anything inside this folder

for app based on template repo
1. clone template repo
2. create a remote called upstream pointing to template repo
3. update framework when necessary by merging upstream into origin

template repo is advisable not to be monorepo

## Shareable libraries and contracts

TBD




- [done] rename `js-node` to js-apps, add js-libs, js-tools (https://github.com/mikemajesty/nestjs-monorepo) should I add back libs here?
  - clone a package from monorepo of a github template project? and able to have updates from upstream?
