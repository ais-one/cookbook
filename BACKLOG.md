## Backlog

For future product improvement

### circleci workflow
- improve structure further (or microservices)
- deploy backend to GCP Cloud Run
- deploy SPA frontend to GCP Storage

### backend
- change out of jest? use native assert instead of chai
- GKE, Kubernetes
- research auto generated REST API and Testing (keep in view dredd.io)
- research websocket testing, improve coverage

### frontend

- https://github.com/vueComponent/ant-design-vue/issues/1913
- PWA cookbook (many things to consider)
- Table & Pagination web component

### others
- graphql security & performance review
- use monorepo when npm 7 is released ?
- VueCrudX ESM build (only possible when UI framework e.g. Vuetify has ESM version and vue-cli can build ESM)
