## Issues

### For next sprint / version
- [TODO]
  - [example-native] migrate example-webpack vue-crud-x table examples to example-native (child table, join tables), (category, author, book - has 1 category, page - belongs to 1 book, book_author)... t4t.js to save to column or to join table
  - [example-app] jsonschema & openapi 3.1
  - [example-vite] cypress e2e testing
- [@es-labs/esm/bwc-combobox.js] - enhancement: replace datalist (so can check multiple times on dropdown instead of closing after each check)
- [@es-labs/esm/bwc-t4t-form.js] - handle multiple parent values use case of combobox..., handle reset of multiple child columns
- [fix] - ==='object' - handle null object
- [chore] disable console.log in production / proper console logging

### Backlog
- [example-webpack] what to do with apollo graphql client???
- [backend-deployment] GKE, Kubernetes
- [frontend-graphql] try @octokit/graphql
- [frontend] aria
- [frontend] AMP

### For future product improvement
- [chore] use monorepo when npm 7 is released ?
- [frontend-i18n] node-polyglot
- [backend-testing] research auto generated REST API and Testing (keep in view dredd.io)
- [backend-testing] research websocket testing
- [backend-testing] change out of jest? use native assert instead of chai
- [vue3] VueCrudX (update to VueJS 3 and Vuetify 3), check on Element UI and Ant Design
