# About

> **TL;DR** ExpressJS, VueJS, ReactJS cookbook, with evergreen recipes and templates (CRUD, CI/CD, QA, Testing, Cloud container deployment, Web Components, ES Modules, etc.) to develop applications faster, while reducing the need for rewrite or refactoring due to changes in dependencies.

Latest Version [0.7.0](https://github.com/ais-one/cookbook/releases/tag/0.7.0) - Released 2023 Sep 01 0830 +8GMT. Ã¥See changes history in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and discuss [here](https://github.com/ais-one/cookbook/discussions)

## IMPORTANT [Read Me First](https://github.com/es-labs/es-labs.github.io/wiki)

## Getting Started

### Install

```bash
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/ais-one/cookbook.git
cd cookbook

# install dependencies for specific workspace projects
# see package.json for shortcut scripts
npm i --workspace=js-node/dbdeploy
npm i --workspace=js-node/services

# install for all workspace projects
npm i --workspaces
```

### Migrate DB And Seed DB

Go to [js-node/dbdeploy/README.md]() project and follow instructions for creating local development db on sqlite

**NOTES**

- MongoDB examples needs MongoDB to work. To resolve, chose one of the methods to install MongoDB in **docs/backend/mongodb/install.md**
- If some env entries are not present there maybe some console log errors (but it is ok to ignore) and websockets will not work. Quick start is still usable. Use the README.md to fill up

### Long Running Processes

For long running processes such as tcp server (event mode, streaming mode), serial server, kafka producer, consumer, cron-triggered process, etc.

See [js-node/README.md](js-node/README.md)

### Vite SPA Setup & Run - development environment

See [https://github.com/es-labs/vue-antd-template]().

Why No SSR or SSG:

- potential slow rendering by server app, added complexity in code, rehydration errors, added complexity in server
- https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/8102
- prefer static sites and lazy loaded SPA for now
