# What Is vue-crud-x

> A VueJS CRUD component which is customisable and extensible to suit more complex situations such as Nested CRUD, custom filters, forms, use of GraphQL or REST to access various datastores. Vuetify is used for layout components but can be changed to alternatives such as ElementUI (by changing components from Vuetify to ElementUI)

## Examples To Get You Up And Running

See the respective README.md files for more information on starting

 * Serverless (best for starters) - https://github.com/ais-one/vue-crud-x/tree/master/example
 * REST (README.md work in progress) - https://github.com/ais-one/vue-crud-x/tree/master/example-rest
 * NUXT (README.md work in progress) - https://github.com/ais-one/vue-crud-x/tree/master/example-nuxt
 * Backend Project - https://github.com/ais-one/vue-crud-x/tree/master/backend (common backend used by both REST and NUXT)

## Differentiating Features From Other CRUD Components

 * Able to do nested CRUD operations, e.g. selecting a post from a list of posts, and then selecting a comment from a list of comments of the selected post to edit
 * Edit inline
 * Pagination
 * Use as component in a page (you can even have multiple components in a single page)
 * Include handling of authentication tokens, and any other user information
 * Permissions
 * Customise
   * Table data format for each cell (e.g., currency to 3 decimal places)
   * Search filters
   * CRUD Form layout & validation (can also be automated)
   * CRUD operations (e.g. disallow delete)
 * (Optional) Auto-configure Search filters, CRUD Forms using JSON data
 * For CRUD operations, you can Use direct call (e.g. Firestore), or API (REST, GraphQL) to one or more types of datastore (MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, ElasticSearch, etc.)
 * Export to CSV, File/Image Upload, i18n
 * Possibly replace Vuetify with something else like ElementUI, Buefy, etc. [Can be done but will be painful]

## What is bad about this CRUD Component

Because of its flexible nature, quite a number of things need to be coded to fit your needs.

However, the good part is that these parts need to be coded anyway and once you find your way around the design, you will be able to quickly create custom CRUD in many of your use cases

# Todo / KIV
 * Look into abort/timeout for async operations without abort/timeout feature (abortable fetch)
 * Take note of the following github issues
   * Fixed Table Header:
     * Fixed Column: https://github.com/lzhoucs/vuetify/pull/4
     * https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues/1547
     * https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/pull/2868
     * https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/pull/3833
   * Infinite Scroll:  https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues/3538
 * Not Urgent: delete related records (e.g. deleting a party will also delete all notes belonging to that party)
 * Not Urgent: v-data-table actions-append: implement later, requires vuetifyjs 1.2.X
 * No need vuelidate or vee-validate, use validation availble in Vuetify - see if it is possible to make common validation rules

None at the moment

# DOCUMENTATION (WIP)

## Properties

Refer to @/pages/Crud/party-inline.js for more description for now...

```
crudTable: {

}

crudFilter: {

}

crudForm: {

}

/* crudOps NOTES
1. user property in payload can be used for authentication, and logging

2. crudOps create, update & delete operation - return object properties

msg: if defined and not blank, snackbar will show the string in msg if enabled (msg can be an vue-i18n keystring)
code: if defined, snackbar will show message based on code number. 200, 201, 509, 500 is handled, other values will show 'unknown operation'
ok:  is operation success or not, used by inline update to revert data to original value on the table

The return object and properties are optional, if you do not return, then the following can potentially result:
- no snackbar (you will need to listen to event emitted do your own error display instead)
- value will not revert to original for failed inline update
*/
crudOps: {
  'export': {
    const { user } = payload
    ...
    // no return
  },
  create: {
    const { record: { id, ...noIdData }, user } = payload
    ...
    return { // EXAMPLE return object with code property omitted
      ok: true,
      msg: 'OK'
    }
  },
  update: {
    const { record: { id, ...noIdData }, user } = payload
    ...
    return { // EXAMPLE return object with ok property only
      ok: true
    }
  },
  delete: {
    const { id, user } = payload
    ...
    // EXAMPLE no return at all
  },
  find: {
    let records = []
    const { pagination, user } = payload // sort order is in pagination
    ...
    return { records, pagination }
  },
  findOne: {
    const { id, user } = payload
    let record = { }
    ...
    return record
  }
}
```

## Events

1. **form-close** - emit event if close form

2. **selected** - row selected, returns object with row item and event, does not fire if inline is truthy...

3. **loaded** - table data is loaded, returns Date.now()

4. **created** - emitted in createRecord(), returns { res, payload } (no create ID yet, will be improved)

5. **updated** - emitted in updateRecord(), returns { res, payload }

6. **deleted** - emitted in deleteRecord(), returns { res, payload }

Note: **res** is the result for the C, U, D operation, payload is the payload passed in to the C, U, D operation
