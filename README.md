## IMPORTANT - Read Me First!

Before we look at frameworks, features, the usual sqa concepts like (testing, etc.), we take a step back and look at improving DX:

- Projects built using a template can merge in template updates without affecting userland code
- Shared libraries should be isolated and versioned, dependents can stay on last-known-good version and update when ready
- Isolation and versioning can be extended to `types` (for Typescript) and API `contracts`
- Allow for and easy way to check for and update outdated dependencies in various projects

This repo uses git submodules to provide an overview of the various cookbook projects as a whole

## Aims
- easily shared
- high reusability
- low technical debt
- low inter-dependency & nested-dependencies

## Resuable JS frameworks how to...

- updateable template design
  - exclude configurable files from repo (e.g. .env), but include sample config files (e.g. .env.sample)
  - create an folder where all custom code is placed, framework must not touch anything inside this folder

- app based on updateable templates
1. clone template repo
2. create a remote called upstream pointing to template repo
3. update framework when necessary by merging upstream into origin

updateable template repo is advisable not to be a monorepo




# About

> **TL;DR** ExpressJS, VueJS, ReactJS cookbook, with evergreen recipes and templates (CRUD, CI/CD, QA, Testing, Cloud container deployment, Web Components, ES Modules, etc.) to develop applications faster, while reducing the need for rewrite or refactoring due to changes in dependencies.

Latest Version [0.7.0](https://github.com/ais-one/cookbook/releases/tag/0.7.0) - Released 2023 Sep 01 0830 +8GMT. Ã¥See changes history in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and discuss [here](https://github.com/ais-one/cookbook/discussions)




## Sandbox

### Install

```bash
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/ais-one/cookbook.git
cd cookbook

### Vite SPA Setup & Run - development environment

See [https://github.com/es-labs/vue-antd-template]().

Why No SSR or SSG:

- potential slow rendering by server app, added complexity in code, rehydration errors, added complexity in server
- https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/8102
- prefer static sites and lazy loaded SPA for now

---

## General Requirements

- git & IDE (e.g. vscode)
- Node 18+ LTS
- Npm 9+ (npm i -g npm@latest `to update`)
- For Windows, **integrate bash shell to cmd shell** (when installing git), or use git-bash
- Docker

1. check dependencies
script to check for and/or update packages... if all repos are in the same project

2. update from upstream for templates
