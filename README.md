# About

> **TL;DR** ExpressJS, VueJS cookbook, with evergreen recipes and templates (CRUD, CI/CD, Cloud container deployment, Web Components, ES Modules) to develop applications faster, while reducing the need for rewrite or refactoring due to changes in dependencies.

Considerations for this project are similar to this [python fullstack project](https://github.com/ais-one/favv/blob/master/README.md#considerations).

**NOTE!** project name is going to be replaced to a more appropriate one

The difference between this project and [https://github.com/ais-one/favv](https://github.com/ais-one/favv) are:
- vue-crud-x is more of a cookbook and recipes are constantly being improved and updated
- favv tries to seperate boiler plate from custom logic for better maintainability
- they complement each other and each can be used to improve on each other

We do not use Typescript because TS people can understand JS easily, but JS-only people need to pickup TS and its ecosystem. It is easier for TS people to take the JS here and implement with TS.

Latest Version [0.6.0](https://github.com/ais-one/vue-crud-x/releases/tag/0.6.0) - Released 2021 July 15 1500 +8GMT

- add openapi example & validation, add rs232 and vercel/pkg usage, allow multiple upload folers handling
- improvement on project organization and preparation for npm workspaces and node 16
- replacing apollo graphql library (bloated, overly complex, breaks badly when major change), removed ORM

# QUICK START - ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE

## Requirements

- NodeJS LTS
- For Windows, **integrate bash shell to cmd shell** (when installing git), or use git-bash
- Docker (easier to use VS Code Docker plugin)

## Download

```bash
# clone repo and install backend
git clone https://github.com/ais-one/vue-crud-x.git
cd vue-crud-x
```

## ExpressJS Backend Setup & Run - development environment

```bash
# install
cd node-express
npm i
npm i ../@es-labs/esm
npm i ../@es-labs/node
```

**NOTES**
- MongoDB examples needs MongoDB to work. To resolve, chose one of the methods to install MongoDB in **docs/mongodb/install.md**
- The **node-express/apps/app-template/config/secret/*.env,js** files are not present. So there maybe some console log errors (but it is ok to ignore) and websockets will not work. Quick start is still usable. Use the README.md to fill up

### Run migration & app

```bash
# create and seed relational db on SQLite, (delete the dev.sqlite file each time before you run this)
# command: npm run knex -- <development / uat / production> <seed / migrate>
npm run knex -- development migrate
npm run knex -- development seed

# create and seed MongoDB requires MongoDB - you can skip this but MongoDB examples will not work
# command: npm run mongo -- <development / uat / production> <seed / update>
npm run mongo -- development seed

# run the backend
# command: npm run app -- <development / uat / production>
npm run app -- development

# or npm run app:lint to include eslint checks
```

**Visit the following URLs**
- http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/healthcheck - app is running normally
- http://127.0.0.1:3000 - Website served by Express with functional samples and demos (click on link to view **native** app or link to view **vite production build** app)
- http://127.0.0.1:3000/api-docs

Note: to generate api docs, visit [node-utils/openapi-file-joiner](node-utils/openapi-file-joiner) and follow readme file, also look at the config properties OPENAPI_PATH and OPENAPI_VALIDATOR in [node-express/apps/app-template/config/common.env.js](node-express/apps/app-template/config/common.env.js).

### No bundler frontend

See **native** app above

### Testing

- To run unit & integration test on /api/authors. E2E testing is **Work In Progress**
- TO TEST EVERYTHING PLEASE change describe.only(...) to describe(...) in the test scripts in node-express/apps/app-template/tests

```bash
# run in development only
npm run test
```

### Long Running Processes

Codes for long running processes
- tcp server (event mode, streaming mode)
- serial server
- kafka producer, consumer
- cron-triggered process

```
cd node-daemons

# Command to simulate long running process (do take note of caveats, for production need a monitor to handle restart strategy)
# command: npm run process-long -- development
npm run process-long

# Command to simulate process triggered by cron (**NOTE:** may be better to use cron to call API than trigger a process)
# command: npm run process-cron -- development
npm run process-cron
```

### Vite SPA Setup & Run - development environment

[Why Use Vite](https://indepth.dev/a-note-on-vite-a-very-fast-dev-build-tool/)

For Push Notification
- using Google FCM, setup your firebase account and messaging, also setup FCM server key in backend
- using self hosted webpush is also supported and available

```bash
cd vue-vite
npm i
npm run dev
```

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ to view application

Login using the following:
- User: test
- Password: test
- OTP (if enabled - e.g. USE_OTP=TEST): use 111111 as otp pin

You can test PWA Push notifications using Webpush or FCM on Dashboard page depending on **.env.<environment>** file configuration (need to be on 127.0.0.1).

Click the following buttons in order (see their output in console.log and screen):
- sub PN (subscribe)
- Test PN (send a test message to user id 1 - on sqlite)
- Unsub PN (unsubscribe)

### Vite SPA - static build

```bash
cd vue-vite
npx vite build --mode development # build into example app, development environment
npx vite build --mode uat # build uat environment, deploy to GCP Storage
```
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000/vite/

## Why No SSR or SSG

- potential slow rendering by server app, added complexity in code, rehydration errors, added complexity in server
- https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/8102
- prefer static sites and lazy loaded SPA for now

## SAML & OIDC

Refer to link below on how to try out...
- [Keycloak](docker-devenv/keycloak/README.md) README.md
- You can test out on the [vue-vite](vue-vite) Signin UI, clicking on SAML button / OIDC button to see redirect callback
- Refer also to the following files
  - [node-express/common/passport.js](node-express/common/passport.js)
  - [node-express/router/saml.js](node-express/router/saml.js)
  - [node-express/router/oidc.js](node-express/router/oidc.js)

---

## Configuration

The [node-express/config](node-express/config) folder contains the config information.

You can override the configurations using <NODE_ENV>.env.js files, e.g. development.env.js or uat.env.js in [node-express/config](node-express/config)

## CI/CD

Using github actions, deploy to GCP Cloud

Manually triggered deployment on .github/workflows/manual.yml

selectable inputs
- environment (uat for now, development does not deploy anything)
- application (node-express, vue-vite)
- code branch

**NOTE** config/secret contents will not be in repo for CI/CD (so you can get errors), those should be put in VAULT

current secrets
- GCP_PROJECT_ID
- GCP_SA_KEY
- VAULT_uat, passed in as VAULT

```
# do not merge
VAULT="unused"

# connect to a hashicorp vault and obtain secrets to merge
VAULT={ url, token } # base64 encoded

 # pass in secrets, this way is insecure and not a good way to send in secrets
VAULT={ secrets: { ... all your secrets here } } # base64 encoded
```

## VERSION CHANGE NOTES

- **v0.5+** Improve organization and authentication, add new features
- **v0.4+** Improve folders and structure organization, handle CI/CD better
- **v0.3+** Reorganize folders and structure, for ease of developing and maintaining multiple applications.
- **v0.2+** uses Vuetify 2. Due to breaking changes from Vuetify 1 to 2, CRUD component code was refactored to be more UI framework agnostic (reduce dependencies!), easier to use, improving code quality, documentation and <a href="https://dev.to/aisone/vuejs-expressjs-crud-cookbook-46l0" target="_blank">supprting article - VueJS+ExpressJS CRUD & Cookbook</a>
- **v0.1** and Vuetify 1 will be supported under the [v1 branch](https://github.com/ais-one/vue-crud-x/tree/v1). You can refer to the v1  <a href="https://medium.com/@aaronjxz/vue-crud-x-a-highly-customisable-crud-component-using-vuejs-and-vuetify-2b1539ce2054" target="_blank">Legacy Article (For Historical Reference)</a>
