## Library Notes

Libs are now found within the example projects.

1. vite (no webpack) - example-web/vite/lib/esm

2. vue (wepback) - example-web/vite/lib/webpacked

3. nodejs and express - example-app/lib/[all others not listed above]

## Projects and Repo

We will find a better way of updating to have correct CI the following folders should have their own repo
- example-app
- example-web/vite
- example-web/spa
- example-web/pwa - to merge it with either spa or vite
- example-web/ssr - to find a better replacement for nuxt
