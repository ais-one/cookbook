## Library Notes

Libs are now found within the example projects.

1. vite (rollup) - example-vite/src/lib/esm-rollup

2. vue (wepback) - example-vite/lib/webpacked

3. nodejs and express - example-app/lib/[all others not listed above]

## Projects and Repo

We will find a better way of updating to have correct CI the following folders should have their own repo
- example-app
- example-native
- example-vite
- example-webpack



## Usage (Improved Modularity - WIP)

npm install <path-to-this-foder-from-where-you-want-to-install-this>
