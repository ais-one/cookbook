# Getting Started - Hands On

> A firebase example project using vue-crud-x component

## Learning To Use Or Maintaining Component (Github)

### Learning

#### clone the repository and go to the repository example
    git clone https://github.com/ais-one/vue-crud-x.git
    cd vue-crud-x/example-firebase

#### install dependencies
    npm install
    # delete package-lock.json if you face problems

#### create cfg.json file & put in your credentials
    touch cfg.json
    vi cfg.json

    {
      "firebaseCfg": {
        "apiKey": "",
        "authDomain": "",
        "databaseURL": "",
        "projectId": "",
        "storageBucket": "",
        "messagingSenderId": ""
      },
      "recaptchaSiteKey": ""  
    }

#### run the app (vue-cli 3)
    npm run serve

# Looking Into example-firebase

## VueCrudX Important Notes

* primary key field name must be id - for now
* the example uses firestore, please signup for firebase and create user on firebase to access
* please see Schema section below for simple schema description, indexing, etc.
* there is a user state which is passed into payload (see bode below)
 - you pass in email or id, to be used in createdBy field, to indicate who created the document/record (optional)
 - you pass in rules object to determine whether to show add, edit, delete button, etc. 
* events emitted: form-close, selected

```
# see use in VueCrudX.vue, you can populate the user state or leave it undefined
async createRecord ({ commit, getters }, payload) {
  payload.user = this.getters.user
  let res = await getters.crudOps.create(payload)
  return res
}
# A sample user JSON - obtained from backend, decoded from JWT or some other means, can look like this
{
  id: '1726388390',
  email: 'abc@mail.com',
}
```

## Folders & Files to take note of

Folders & Files providing examples of how the user can use or customize this vue-crud-x component

### Mulitple CRUD Component on a page [created in the vue file]

**/src/pages/MultiCrud**

* Two components are shown on a single page (you can also add other components on the page, e.g. maps, charts, other vue components)
* Clicking on a party in the party table on the left will select all notes related to that party and display the list of notes on the right (you may need to apply the correct filter on the right table to see the data)
* On the party table, the icons on the left are to open update dialog or to delete the party
* On the party notes table, just click row to open a dialog which you can use to edit or delete the row
  - there is no "go back" button to return it to parent component (it is set to hidden for this case, as to is not needed)
* Files:
  - Example.vue: example page showing multi-crud usage
  - party.js: the definitions for party collection
  - party-notes.js: definitions for party-note collection

### Single CRUD Component on a page

**/src/pages/Crud**

* Example Showing the following inline edit and how to just use the component in the router without create Vue file
* Files:
  - party-inline.js: inline edit example
  - party-common.js: common properties used in other files in this folder

* Another example to show nested CRUD
* Files:
  - party.vue: example PARENT in nested crud
  - PartyForm.vue
    - custom form component, included into a scoped slot
    - there is a button that leads you to the CHILD table
    - no filter file, autogenerated from filters specified in party.vue
  - partyNotes.vue: example CHILD in nested crud
    - notes based on party selected. records are retrieved based on a parent Key (can be primary key or unique key), further filtered by search conditions
  - partyNotesForm.vue
    - custom form component, included into a scoped slot
    - no filter file, autogenerated from filters specified in partyNotes.vue

### Realtime Example

**/src/pages/Realtime**

* Demonstrates use of firestore realtime capabilities. Open 2 windows, update one record, the update should be pushed to the other client also
* Files:
  - Example.vue: example page showing multi-crud usage

## Notes Creation Of vue-cli3 project From Scratch

vue create [project name]
Manually select features
Babel, Linter, CSS Preporcessors
Stylus
ESLint + Standard config
Lint on save
dedicated config file (for babel, postcss, eslint, etc)
Save this as a preset? N

# Supplementary Material

## Hosting To Firebase

https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart

1. Install Firebase

```
npm install -g firebase-tools (first time)
firebase login (first time)
cd to project folder
firebase init (first time)
add files
```

2. Build the production version first

```
npm run build
# optional: build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
# npm run build --report
```

3. Deploy to Firebase

```
firebase deploy --only hosting
firebase logout
```

## Storage Rules

```
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## Other Notes (For reference only)

vuejs filters, local or global

v-model.lazy.trim.number (v-model modifiers)

computed: for non-async data
 - get, set (used for non-referenced data), [be careful when using set, also note that if computed is undefined, it will cause problems]
watch: for async data
 - newval, oldval
 - deep watching

v-if (create / remove the block, can use v-else)
v-show (still renders block, but hide it)

: v-bind classes, styles
@ v-on submit, keyup

v-for="(item,index)" in items :key="item.id"
or (value, key, index) if looping object

ref is non-reactive

vue lifecycle avoid beforeUpdate or update, use computed & watchers first

# migrating from file imports to slots

If you are using the crud component JS files, you need to convert it to Vue first
create a .vue file

```
<template>
  <vue-crud-x :parentId="null" v-bind="partyDefs">
    <template v-slot:filter="{ filters, parentId }">
      <my-filter :filters="filters" :parentId="parentId" />
    </template>
    <template v-slot:form="{ record, parentId }">
      <my-form :record="record" :parentId="parentId" />
    </template>
  </vue-crud-x>
</template>

<script>
import VueCrudX from '../../../../src/VueCrudX' // Component shared between projects // const VueCrudX = Vue.component('vue-crud-x') this does not work...
import MyFilter from './Filter'
import MyForm from './PartyForm'

</script>

```

in the scripts, you should put the defs into data()

        FilterVue: null,

        FormVue: () => {},
