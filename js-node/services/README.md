## Long Running Applications


### TCP Server

`tcp_server.js` is a TCP server application that supports both event and streaming connections

The following are the `.env` settings

```
TCP_PORT=4000
TCP_HOST=0.0.0.0
TCP_APPNAME=stream-app
TCP_STREAMING_MODE=1
TCP_CLIENT_LIMIT=100
```

TCP_APPNAME is the filename to be used

TCP_STREAMING_MODE
- event mode closes client after data is received
- streaming mode keeps client open, it can be configured to handle a limited number of clients

TCP_CLIENT_LIMIT
- limits number of TCP connections
- 0 means unlimited connections


Run using the following command

```bash
$ node tcp_server.js
```

### Scaled Websockets

`scaled-ws.js` is use to demonstrate horizontal scaling of websockets using Redis PubSub, it also includes
- upgrade event and authentication
- setting an id

#### Usage

Redis should be available on its default port on localhost

```
npm i
npm start -- 3000
npm start -- 3001
```

Use the following website to test

https://www.websocket.org/echo.html

connect 3 clients to 3000
connect 2 clients to 3001

See output when sending message from a client (currently client that sent will also receive its own message)

#### Notes

If going through a proxy such as load balancer, need sticky sessions

TBD: handle duplicate message to message originator client on subscription message
