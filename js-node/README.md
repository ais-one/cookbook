To test out

```
cd js-node/wip

# Command to simulate long running process (do take note of caveats, for production need a monitor to handle restart strategy)
# command: npm run process-long -- development
npm run process-long

# Command to simulate process triggered by cron (**NOTE:** may be better to use cron to call API than trigger a process)
# command: npm run process-cron -- development
npm run process-cron
```




# Useful commands

redirect to a file with date 

```bash
echo abc.java >> logfile.`date +'%Y-%m-%d'`.log
#or
echo abc.java >> "logfile.$(date +'%Y-%m-%d').log"
```
