 * save row button for inline edit (reduce API calls)
 * add row button, allow popup for user to enter data for field/s before row is added (e.g. specify a date or name)
 * [Breaking Change - really sorry for this] use full component name for inline edit (v-select instead of select, so in future you can include your own)

### Version 0.0.23
 * [Major Breaking Change] improved Inline Edit, use attributes object with v-bind instead of hardcoding attributes
   * supports: v-text-field, v-select, v-combobox, v-autocomplete, v-textarea, v-date-picker, v-time-picker
   * all inputs need to use the new way of defining the objects
   * Example Usage: @/Components/Crud/party-inline.js
 * [MINOR breaking change] improved Auto-generated Filters and Forms, use attributes object with v-bind instead of hardcoding attributes
   * supports: v-text-field, v-select, v-combobox, v-autocomplete, v-textarea, v-date-picker, v-time-picker
   * v-select is broken and needs to use the new way of defining the objects
   * Example Usage: @/Components/Crud/party-inline.js
 * improve look of progress loaders
   * prefer to use linear progress bars rather than circular fullscreen dialog (especially, when you have multiple crud components in a page)
 * added WebCam and DrawingCanvas components in test page for example on capture of photo an signatures in a form

 * still using vuetify 1.2.3, as the popup dialog transparency from 1.2.4 is a problem

 * Update project README.md and example README.md

### Version 0.0.21
 * user permissions

 * Move the doPage & crudTitle props into crudTable props as objects (breaking change on pagination flag)
 * update vuetify to 1.2.2
 * add textarea input type for inline edits
 * crud improvement
   * add actionColumn (if true, table row has edit/delete icons)
   * option to create new record via dialog (current & default behaviour) or by adding row
   * if you have actionColumn but no inline edit fields, clicking on row will emit 'selected' event
   * REST API example repository (https://github.com/ais-one/udemy/tree/master/vue-firebase)
   * Mutiple CRUD in a page
     * Working example on using parent and child table in same page
     * Scroll to top example included
   * half-sized filter inputs on wider screens (see halfSize property)

   * see party-inline.js for example settings and comments

### Version 0.0.19
 * pagination example (yes with firebase — only problem is that all records are loaded (e.g. 50 records) every time find is triggered, and page size is 5). Good thing is, you can use the example and it will work well on a DB supporting Total record count, Limit and Offset.
 * improve inline edit
 * use VueI18n for translations, and include Vuetify i18n
   * one for Vuetify
   * one for VueCrudX
   * the rest for your app
 * clean up firebase code, fix firestore duplicate check for update (thanks @gakera)
 * example implementation as component (you can use it on a page with charts or google maps, etc)
 * no breaking changes but... need to install vue-i18n
 * update vuetify to 1.1.12
 * firebase transactions and pagination example in party-inline.js
   * not really true server side pagination as limit / offset is expensive in firebase (skipped records are charged)
   * but it serves as a good example for server side pagination implementation
 * use HTTP status codes as CRUD operation result return values, for use with snackbar and calling function (non breaking change)
 * it is possible to work with NuxtJS (https://github.com/ais-one/nuxt-vcx)

### Version 0.0.18
 * update firebase packages & vuetify to 1.1.10
 * set vue-crud-x dependency tag to latest in example folder package.json
 * add snackbar to notify results of CRUD operations (configurable and can be disabled)
 * dynamic initial values (e.g. timestamp), see defaultRec implemented as function (no breaking change as you can still use defaultRec as object)
 * confimation for create / delete / update operations (confirmation can be individually disabled)
 * use native Javascript instead of Vuetify confirm dialog (reduce code and simplify code), will use Vuetify again once I can come up with simpler logic for it.
 * add inline-edit mode (use with care)

### Version 0.0.17
 * add progress indicator (thin line to upper part) to all async operations
 * use type="date" instead of datepicker, reduce code

   - Good news, you only need to update this component, you need not do anything on your custom code

### Version 0.0.13
 * add badges to README.MD
 * update to vuetify 1.0.17
 * add makeCsvRow helper in assets/util.js, see sample in the example application (just pass in an object from an array and get the CSV), some improvements still needed

### Version 0.0.12
* Improved on the schema example
  - Party collection (a party to lawsuit)
  - Notes collection (case notes on party)
  - 1 party can have 0 to N notes
  - in the example: click on party, select a party, there is a button to go to case notes of that party
* Align all icons right

### Version 0.0.11

* replace moment with date-fns
* update to vuetify 1.0.16
* remove unused packages vuefire & toastr, install vue-i18n

* add sort demo for 'Date Time' column of Note
