 * confimation for create / delete / update operations (confirmation can be individually disabled)
 * use native Javascript instead of Vuetify confirm dialog (reduce code and simplify code), will use Vuetify again once I can come up with simpler logic for it.

### Version 0.0.12
* Improved on the schema example
  - Party collection (a party to lawsuit)
  - Notes collection (case notes on party)
  - 1 party can have 0 to N notes
  - in the example: click on party, select a party, there is a button to go to case notes of that party
* Align all icons right
